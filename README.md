# My Nixos Config

This is my Nixos config, I use Hyprland with Kitty for my windowmanager and terminal emulator, with neovim for my code editor. If you have any cool suggestions for where to take my config feel free to email me at caleb.f.beeson@gmail.com.

## Future Endeavours
- Create host for my desktop
- Create universal host that can run from usb flash drive
- Setup virtual machine software
- Set up a sleeping or idle mechanism
- Properly configure discord
- Get a proper method for setting up development environments (Nix Shell or Devenv potentially)
- Rice my shit

## Later fixes
- Go fix your shitty mess for hyprshot and modularize it more
